# Snow Trace Measuremnt Tool


## Idea
We wanted to create a tool that notifies city workers and snow maintenance crews about snow conditions outside. We designed a box that has a camera and force and temperature sensor that determines if there was a significant amount of snow and the type of snow which would then send a text to city workers/road maintenance workers.  

## What we used:
* OpenCV to determine amount of snow in box 
* Arduino with temperature and force sensors 
* Node Red to bring everything together 
* Twilio API
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend 


## Challenges:
* Communication between Arduino and program 
* Setting up camera for OpenCV
* Using Node Red to bring together all elements 

## Next Steps:
* Use more API's to send notifications on different platforms to users
* Have lights/sound to create a buzzer to notify users of snow levels 
* Utilizing UI to get user input
